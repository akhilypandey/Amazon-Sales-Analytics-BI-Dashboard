## 📖 Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of a comprehensive Amazon India sales dataset. The goal was to develop an interactive **Power BI Dashboard** that provides actionable insights into sales trends, order fulfillment, and regional performance.

The dashboard enables stakeholders to track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, order distribution, and product category performance, facilitating data-driven decision-making for inventory and sales strategies.

## 🗝️ Key Metrics & Insights
Based on the analysis of **~129K orders** across the dataset, the following insights were derived:

* **Total Revenue:** The dataset accounts for **₹78.59 Million** in sales.
* **Customer Segmentation:** The business is overwhelmingly B2C (Consumer), with **99.32%** of orders coming from retail customers and only **0.68%** from B2B.
* **Product Performance:**
    * **"Set"** (likely Kurta sets) is the highest-grossing category, generating **₹3.92 Crores**, followed by **Kurtas** at **₹2.12 Crores**.
    * Western wear (Dresses and Tops) contributes a smaller but significant portion of revenue (~₹1.65 Crores combined).
* **Regional Dominance:**
    * **Maharashtra** is the leading state for orders, followed closely by **Karnataka**.
    * Major metro cities (**Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Mumbai**) are the top contributors to sales volume.
* **Order Status:** The dashboard tracks detailed fulfillment statuses, including Shipped, Cancelled, and Delivered orders.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Data Visualization:** Microsoft Power BI
* **Data Transformation:** Power Query (ETL) & DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
* **Data Source:** Sales transaction data (CSV/Excel)

## 📊 Dashboard Features
The interactive report includes the following visual components:
1.  **KPI Cards:** At-a-glance view of Total sales revenue (78.59M), Quantity Sold, and Total Orders.
2.  **Geographic Map:** A state-wise distribution of sales to identify high-performing regions (Heatmap).
3.  **Category Bar Chart:** A breakdown of `Sum of Qty` and `Revenue` by product category (Set, Kurta, Western Dress, etc.).
4.  **Fulfillment Donut Charts:** Visualizing the split between B2B vs. Retail and Order Status distribution.

## 🚀 How to Use
1.  Download the `.pbix` file from this repository.
2.  Open using **Microsoft Power BI Desktop**.
3.  Interact with the filters (Status, Category, State) on the left panel to slice and dice the data.
